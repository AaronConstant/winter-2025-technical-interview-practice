// create some warm up exercises involving loops
// 1. Counting: create a function that prints out the numbers 1-10
// 2. Evens: create a function that prints out the even numbers 1-20
// 3. FizzBuzz: create a function that prints out the numbers 1-100. If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
