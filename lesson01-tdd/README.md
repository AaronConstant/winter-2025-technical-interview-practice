### What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. The process follows three steps:
1. Red: Write a failing test
2. Green: Write the minimal code to make the test pass
3. Refactor: Improve the code while keeping tests green

### The Simplest Valid Case Approach
- Start with the most basic, valid input
- Gradually add complexity
- Handle edge cases last

### Benefits of TDD
1. Clearer requirements
2. Better code design
3. Confidence in changes
4. Built-in documentation
5. Fewer bugs

### Example: Writing a Sum Function
