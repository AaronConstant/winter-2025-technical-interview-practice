# Lesson 14: Heaps and Priority Queues

## Warm-up Written Question (15 minutes)
What is the relationship between a binary heap and a priority queue? How do they differ from regular binary trees?

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Understanding Heaps
1. Heap Properties
   - Complete binary tree
   - Heap ordering (min-heap/max-heap)
   - Array representation
   - Parent-child relationships

2. Basic Operations
   - Insertion
   - Deletion (extract min/max)
   - Heapify
   - Decrease/Increase key

3. Applications
   - Priority queues
   - Heap sort
   - Graph algorithms
   - Event scheduling

### Implementation Techniques
1. Array-based Implementation
   - Index calculations
   - Space efficiency
   - Cache performance
   - Memory management

2. Operations Analysis
   - Time complexity
   - Space complexity
   - Performance considerations
   - Common pitfalls

3. Advanced Topics
   - Binomial heaps
   - Fibonacci heaps
   - D-ary heaps
   - Custom comparators

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)
Today's problem focuses on implementing a min-heap and using it to solve a practical problem.

## Recap (15 minutes)
- Review of heap operations
- Common use cases
- Best practices discussion
