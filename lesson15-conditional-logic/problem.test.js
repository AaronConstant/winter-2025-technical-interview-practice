// Before you implement this class, create a test case for the following scenario:

// A teenager with a GPA of 3.5 wants to attend a concert that starts at 8 PM and lasts for 3 hours. The teenager is not grounded. The system should return true, with a message explaining why permission was granted.

// A teenager with a GPA of 2.0 wants to attend a party that starts at 9 PM and lasts for 4 hours. The teenager is not grounded. The system should return false, with a message explaining why permission was denied.

// A teenager with a GPA of 2.8 wants to attend a study group that starts at 7 PM and lasts for 2 hours. The teenager is not grounded. The system should return true, with a message explaining why permission was denied.
