## Repository Structure

Each lesson folder contains:

- `warmup.js` - Syntax exercises and coding challenges
- `README.md` - Lecture content, written questions, and notes
- `problem.js` - LeetCode-style problem implementation
- `problem.test.js` - Test cases for the problem

## Lesson Structure

Each lesson will follow a standard pattern.

- Warm-up (10 minutes)
- Written Question (5 minutes)
- Lecture Content (20 minutes)
- Problem Solving (35 minutes)
- Recap (15 minutes)
- Additional Resources

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your forked repository

## Running Tests

Each lesson folder comes with a `problem.test.js` file that contains tests for that lesson's problems.  
In order to run the test for that lesson got to your terminal and type  
`npm run test ./lesson**`, where `**` is the lesson number.  
Then hit `tab` to autocomplete the folder.  
This should run only the tests for that particular lesson.
