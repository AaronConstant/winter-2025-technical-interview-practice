### Warm-up (10 minutes)

### Written Question (5 minutes)

**Question:** Why do you think it's important to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm? Provide one example where inefficient code could cause real-world problems.

(Allow students to write a brief response. This question helps set the stage for why big O notation is critical in computer science and software engineering.)

### Lecture Content (20 minutes)

1. **Definition and Importance**

   - Define big O notation as a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, often used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
   - Explain why it's crucial for understanding the scalability and efficiency of algorithms, especially in resource-limited applications or large-scale data processing.

2. **Common Big O Notations**

   - Discuss the most common big O complexities: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n), and O(n!).
   - Show simple algorithm examples for each complexity: constant time, linear time, quadratic time

3. **Visualizing Big O**

   - Use graphical representations to compare how different functions grow. Graph the number of operations versus the size of the input for various complexities.

4. **Best, Worst, and Average Cases**
   - Describe how algorithms can have different complexities depending on the input and how big O focuses on the worst-case scenario to ensure algorithm robustness.
