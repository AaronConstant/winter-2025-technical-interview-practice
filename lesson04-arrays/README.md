# Lesson 4: Arrays Fundamentals

## Warm-up Written Question (15 minutes)
What is the difference between Array.prototype.slice() and Array.prototype.splice()? How does mutability play a role in these methods?

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Array Basics
1. Array Creation and Access
   - Literal notation
   - Array constructor
   - Accessing elements
   - Length property

2. Array Methods
   - Adding/Removing elements (push, pop, shift, unshift)
   - Modifying arrays (splice, slice)
   - Searching arrays (indexOf, includes)
