# Lesson 9: Stacks and Queues

## Warm-up Written Question (15 minutes)
What are the key differences between stacks and queues? Provide real-world examples where each data structure would be most appropriate.

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Understanding Stacks and Queues
1. Stack Operations
   - Push and Pop
   - LIFO (Last In, First Out)
   - Common applications
   - Implementation approaches

2. Queue Operations
   - Enqueue and Dequeue
   - FIFO (First In, First Out)
   - Priority queues
   - Circular queues

3. Implementation Considerations
   - Array-based implementation
   - Linked list-based implementation
   - Time complexity analysis
   - Space efficiency

### Common Applications
1. Stack Applications
   - Function call stack
   - Undo/Redo operations
   - Expression evaluation
   - Backtracking algorithms

2. Queue Applications
   - Task scheduling
   - Print queue management
   - Breadth-first search
   - Message queues

3. Performance Considerations
   - Time complexity of operations
   - Space complexity
   - Memory management
   - Common pitfalls

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)
Today's problem focuses on implementing a queue using two stacks.

## Recap (15 minutes)
- Review of stack/queue operations
- Implementation trade-offs
- Best practices discussion
