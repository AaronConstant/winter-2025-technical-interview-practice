# Lesson 12: Stacks Continued

## Warm-up Written Question (10 minutes)
Explain how stacks can be used to check for balanced symbols (e.g., parentheses, brackets, and curly braces) in an expression. Why is the LIFO property important for this task?

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Deep Dive into Stack Applications
1. Balanced Symbols
   - Parentheses validation
   - Brackets and curly braces in code editors

2. Expression Evaluation
   - Postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation)
   - Converting infix to postfix

3. Stack-Based Algorithms
   - Backtracking
   - Depth-first search (DFS)

4. Performance Considerations
   - Time complexity of stack operations
   - Memory usage in stack-based recursion

### Real-World Use Cases
- Compilers and interpreters
- Undo/Redo operations
- Parsing nested structures like HTML/XML

## Problem-Solving Focus
Implementing the **Valid Parentheses** problem to solidify stack-based problem-solving skills.
