# Lesson 8: Linked Lists

## Warm-up Written Question (15 minutes)
Compare and contrast arrays and linked lists. What are the trade-offs in terms of time complexity for common operations?

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Understanding Linked Lists
1. Types of Linked Lists
   - Singly linked lists
   - Doubly linked lists
   - Circular linked lists

2. Basic Operations
   - Insertion (beginning, middle, end)
   - Deletion
   - Traversal
   - Search

3. Common Patterns
   - Runner technique
   - Reversing a linked list
   - Detecting cycles
   - Finding middle node

### Implementation Techniques
1. Node Structure
   - Data storage
   - Next/Previous pointers
   - Memory allocation

2. Edge Cases
   - Empty list
   - Single node
   - Multiple nodes
   - Circular references

3. Performance Considerations
   - Time complexity
   - Space complexity
   - Memory management

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)
Today's problem focuses on manipulating linked lists and handling edge cases.

## Recap (15 minutes)
- Review of linked list operations
- Common patterns and techniques
- Best practices discussion
