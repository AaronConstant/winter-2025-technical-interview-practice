# Lesson 7: Recursion

## Warm-up Written Question (15 minutes)
What is the difference between iteration and recursion? When would you choose one over the other?

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Understanding Recursion
1. What is Recursion?
   - Base case
   - Recursive case
   - Call stack

2. Types of Recursion
   - Direct recursion
   - Indirect recursion
   - Tail recursion
   - Tree recursion

3. Common Recursive Patterns
   - Linear recursion (e.g., factorial)
   - Binary recursion (e.g., fibonacci)
   - Multiple recursion (e.g., tree traversal)

### Writing Recursive Solutions
1. Identifying the Base Case
   - When to stop
   - Multiple base cases
   - Edge cases

2. Building the Recursive Case
   - Breaking down the problem
   - Progress toward base case
   - Combining results

3. Recursion vs Iteration
   - Space complexity considerations
   - Stack overflow concerns
   - Performance implications

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)
Today's problem focuses on implementing a recursive solution and comparing it with an iterative approach.

## Recap (15 minutes)
- Review of recursive patterns
- Common pitfalls
- Best practices for recursion
